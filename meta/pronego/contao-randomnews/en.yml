    description: >
        This extension allows you to select "Random News" as a module in the Contao backend 
        and display random news from selectable news archives in various formats.

        It was originally developed by Heiko Unger from Odenwerk (odenwerk@gmail.com) 
        and maintained until around 2013. At the request of Lothar Schwalm (https://die-schreibmaus.de, current sponsor), 
        the extension was taken over in 2023 by Dr. Manuel Lamotte-Schubert/PRONEGO (https://www.pronego.com) 
        after unsuccessful attempts to contact the original developer and was adapted for Contao 5.
