        With the Contao GDPR plugin, you can create a new page for your privacy policy at any time. 
        If something changes – whether on your website or in legal requirements – you can easily regenerate your 
        privacy policy. This ensures that your privacy policy is always up to date. 
        The same applies to the legal notice (imprint) and the cancellation policy.
        
        To configure, simply use the generator at https://easyrechtssicher.de.
        
        The installation is super easy. After selecting it in the Contao Store, 
        simply enter the API key in the settings and then create one or more frontend 
        modules of the type "easyRechtssicher."  
        Integration into an article is done using the "Module" type, where you select 
        the desired module.
