    title: Lazy Image Styling
    description: >
        This bundle adds inline styling for each image that is loaded lazily.
        The styling adds a before-element to the image container, which reserves the space for the image.
        This way, when the images are reloaded, the content of the web page is not affected.

        The padding for the before-element is calculated dynamically for all image sizes used and the corresponding media queries are created in the CSS.

        Newer browsers have the CSS attribute "ratio" for this, but with the calculated styling you can also address older browsers.
