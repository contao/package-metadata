    description: >
        With the XLIFF export-import tool, the contents of a Contao installation can be exported and
        be exported for translation and imported again. Besides the normal content of Contao, also
        the multilingual content of MetaModels can be are exported or imported.

        The export is an XLIFF file that can be read by common translation tools. For example, with
        the tool Poedit. In cooperation with translation agencies, XLIFF is standard.

        Once the translations have been entered into the exported XLIFF file, it can be imported
        again.

        Export and import are carried out via console calls - the configuration via
        a YAML file to be created by the user.

        The following modules are currently supported: Contao (core), MetaModels (data),
        RockSolid Custom-Elements.
