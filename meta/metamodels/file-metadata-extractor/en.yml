    title: MetaModels File Metadata Extractor
    description: >
        The file metadata extraction reads out metadata from files - metadata
        is additional information that is "hidden" in the file. Known are EXIF and IPTC
        data, for example, which in image formats such as JPG/PNG contain information
        about exposure, camera type, flash, author, geo-coordinates, etc.
        Metadata is also available in text formats such as DOC/DOCX/PDF in the form
        of author, description, etc. Just like patient data in digital
        MRI/CT/X-ray images in DICOM format.
