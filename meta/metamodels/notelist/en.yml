    title: MetaModels Notelist
    description: >
        The note list or watch list extends MetaModels by the possibility of adding
        individual data sets (items) to a watch list, remove them and then filter them. 
        Optionally, additional data can be specified when adding items. A transfer of the
        watch list items to a form is possible. 

        Possible use cases for the watch list include e.g a "normal watch list", 
        comparison lists, product properties, or shopping basket functions.
