    title: MetaModels Notelist
    description: >
        The note list or watch list extends MetaModels by the possibility of adding
        individual data sets (items) to a watch list and add individual data sets
        (items) to a watch list, remove them and then filter them. Optionally,
        additional data can be specified when adding items. A transfer of the
        watch list items to a form is possible. 

        Possible uses for the watch list range from a "normal watch list" to
        comparison lists, for example to comparison lists, e.g. of product
        properties, to shopping basket functions.
