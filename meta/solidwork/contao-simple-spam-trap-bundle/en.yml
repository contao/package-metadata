  title: Contao Simple Spam Trap Bundle
  description: >
    This bundle adds two simple yet effective spam protection mechanisms to Contao 4.13 forms:
    a time trap (minimum time, default 8 seconds, validated server-side) and a honeypot field (invisible, accessible).
    It provides German default error messages and automatically includes a lightweight CSS file.
    The goal is lean, reliable anti-spam protection without complex configuration.
