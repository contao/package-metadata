    description: >
        Adds newsletter functionality to Contao. It allows to manage different newsletters and recipient
        lists. Sending newsletters is done directly from the back end as well and styling them is very easy thanks
        to the Contao templating system.

        Subscribe and unsubscribe modules for the front end are of course shipped as well and double opt-in is supported.
