    title: MonitoringClientSensorGoogleMaps Module for Contao 4
    description: >
        The MonitoringClientSensorGoogleMaps bundle adds a sensor for the Contao-Monitoring extension with which use of Google Maps data can be read.
        The bundle only works with the Google maps extension dlh_googlemaps and lists, when the extension is installed,
        how many maps exist and returns the API key together with the domain of the website root on which they are registered.
