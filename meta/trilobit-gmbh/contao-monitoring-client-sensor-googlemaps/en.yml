    title: Contao 4 MonitoringClientSensorGoogleMaps Module
    description: >
        The MonitoringClientSensorGoogleMaps module adds a sensor for the Contao-Monitoring extension with which Google Maps data can be read out.
        The module only works with the google maps extension dlh_googlemaps and reads out if the extension is installed,
        how many maps exist and returns the API key together with the domain of the website root on wich they are registered.
