    title: JointForms Bundle for Contao 4 / Contao 5
    description: >
        Use the JointForms bundle to merge several forms to a multi-stage form process, e.g. a multi-page application form.
        Form data will be persisted in the members' section. Use Symfony Expression Language to define dependencies of forms.
        The member may pause the form process and may login later to continue.
        Use config.yml for configuration.
