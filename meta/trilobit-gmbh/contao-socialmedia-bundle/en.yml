    title: Contao 4 Socialmedia Bundle
    description: >
        The Social Media Bundle is basically a wrapper that allows you to bundle different link collections.
        In addition, images can be included in the links. To create some comfort, it is possible to attach parameters via Wizard.
        After a collection or a wrapper has been created, you can create a module for it and integrate this on any page.
        The HTML structure used is that of a navigation element.
