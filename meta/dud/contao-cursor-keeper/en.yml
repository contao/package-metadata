    title: Cursor Keeper
    description: >
        This small free extension helps you avoid losing focus when working with the built-in code editor.
        After saving a file, the cursor stays where it was and no longer jumps back to the beginning of the file.
        No configuration is required — installing is enough.
        If you like this extension, feel free to support the development with a cup of coffee. Thank you!
