    title: ODD Theme
    description: >
        ODD is a Contao theme developed for creative websites based on Bootstrap.

        The theme is optimized for all devices and popular browsers and brings you by default all sorts of useful elements for your website, such as: Content-Slider, Price-Boxes and of course all modules and elements of the Contao-Core in the creative ODD-style and in three different color schemes.

        Headers, footers, sliders, colors, layouts and, of course, all content can easily be adapted to your requirements.

        TO "SKEW"? If desired, you can also configure the diagonal ODD elements;)

        The ODD Theme is available for free (with copyright notice) or for a fee (without copyright notice).
