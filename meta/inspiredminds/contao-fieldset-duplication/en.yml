    title: Fieldset Duplication
    description: >
        This extension allows a visitor to dynamically add additional form fields to a form in the front end generated by the form generator. For example, if you need to query contact data of an unknown number of persons, you can put these fields together in a fieldset and then let the visitor duplicate these fields dynamically in the front end.
