        Contao extension which provides the ability to sort a news list based on Google Analytics metrics for each news article. It calculates a "Google Analytics Metrics Score" for each enabled news archive daily, based on either the page view or average time on page - or both. This is useful if you want to showcase the most popular news entries.
