    title: Event Image Override
    description: >
        Allows the image settings of each event in Contao to override the image settings of the event module. 
        
        Usually Contao overrides the teaser image size of the event with the image size of the event module, if defined. This extension reverses this logic, i.e. whenever an image size is defined in the event, that image size will be used when the teaser image is rendered.
