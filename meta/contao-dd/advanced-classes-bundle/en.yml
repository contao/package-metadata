        The module extends the css classes of contao elements with self-definable sets of css classes. Editors and admins can quickly access pre-defined css classes via select fields.

        With our configurator (still in development) the sets can be easily adapted to your requirements.

        For Bootstrap and Materialize a pre-defined set for column width, column offset, order (pull/push) and visibility is already included.
