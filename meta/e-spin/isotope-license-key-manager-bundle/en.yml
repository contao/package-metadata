    title: License manager for Isotope
    description: >
        The extension can be used to manage licence keys and sell them as a product - e.g. for access tokens
        for training courses, surveys, paywalls or admission.

        Licence management is activated for a product type. Any number of licence keys can be any number
        of licence keys can be managed. If the product is purchased, licence keys are assigned for the
        corresponding number licence keys are assigned in the shopping basket. The licences are only
        transferred to the customer once payment has been made.
