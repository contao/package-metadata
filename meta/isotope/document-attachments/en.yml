    title: X-Invoice/ZUGFeRD for Isotope eCommerce
    description: >
        X-Invoice (also called ZUGFeRD in Germany) defines the European standard for electronic invoices,
        according to which machine-readable XML data is integrated into a PDF file. With this extension, you can
        attach an XML file to PDF documents from Isotope eCommerce. The content of this file is flexibly generated
        from Contao templates, so it can be adapted to any requirements.

        A template for X-Invoice/ZUGFeRD documents is included, enabling easy implementation of electronic invoices in Isotope eCommerce.
