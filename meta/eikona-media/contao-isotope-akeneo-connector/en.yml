    description: >
        Connect your Contao CMS to the PIM software of Akeneo and import products, attributes, categories from Akeneo to your website, landing pages or any other web based product presentation.
        The Contao-Akeneo-Connector connects the Isotope eCommerce extension for Contao via API with the Product Information Management System of Akeneo.

        Out of the box, the following data can be imported from Akeneo to Contao CMS:
            - Products
            - Categories
            - Attributes
            - Images
            - Product families
            - Cross-Selling-Articles

        The import is executed automatically and synchronizes changes in Akeneo with Contao according to the configured sync time.
        For more information on prices or a demonstration of the connector, simply contact us by mail.
