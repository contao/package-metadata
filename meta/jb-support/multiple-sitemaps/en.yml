    title: Multiple Sitemaps Bundle
    description: >
        The extension provides a new way for Contao to manage multiple sitemaps and index files:
         - Setup multiple sitemaps with own filenames / URL paths
         - Choose sitemap indexing for every single page in page-tree
         - Define entry priority and cache TTL for each sitemap individually
         - Filter indexed pages by page tree (root or sub nodes possible - even multiple)
         - Create index files for existing sitemaps
    keywords:
        - Sitemap
