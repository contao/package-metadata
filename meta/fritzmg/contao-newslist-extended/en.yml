    title: Newslist Extended
    description: >
        Adds a few more features to the news list front end module.

        Override redirect page: This enables you to define a redirect page other than the one defined in the news archive of the news entry. This can be useful in situations where you have just one news archive, but you want to display the entries of that news archive over multiple domains or languages. This also automatically adds a canonical tag on the news reader page, if the page is not the one defined in the news archive.

        News reader module: This enables you to define a news reader module, just like in the news archive module. As usual, the defined news reader module will be displayed in place of the news list module, if the redirect page of a news entry points to the same page where the news list module is located.
