        Put an end to the cookie chaos! Manage cookies & services on Contao websites easily & clearly directly from
        the Contao backend. We rely on "Klaro! - a free and open source consent tool, which provides a user-friendly
        cookie banner for obtaining user consent and reliably blocks the loading of services until then. Klaro is
        DSGVO compliant, easy to configure, lightweight and compatible with all modern browsers. For a lightning-fast
        setup, we have prepared a comprehensive configuration file for you with over 20 services. You can find out
