    title: Bynder Assets Management
    description: >
        This bundle integrates Bynder Asset Management directly into your Contao 4.4+ back end. Because as of today,
        Contao can only work with images that have been uploaded to the file system (no file system abstraction yet), it
        works by adding a new tab next to the regular file picker tab where you can choose your images of your Bynder
        Asset Management account. You can search and filter your Bynder assets, download and then select them right from
        the file tree widget.
