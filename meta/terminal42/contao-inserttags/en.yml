        Create InsertTags to replace content in front- or backend.
        The Custom InsertTags module is a powerful tool to dynamically change your website content. You can add as many
        inserttags as you like, order them and apply rules. Limit certain insert tags to pages, specific dates and/or
        times of the day, or even define your own custom rules. The syntax for embedding the inserttags is
        [{]custom::inserttag_name[}], you can place them in your own content modules of your page layout
        (e.g. "Custom HTML Code") or in the WYSIWYG editor.

        Here are a few examples:

        Use an inserttag to define a content image, and limit different images to different pages.
        Display a welcome-greeting to your user. "Good Morning" from 06 am to 11 am, "Good Evening" from 5 pm to 10 pm, and "Hello" the other times of the day.
        Display a gender-specific greeting like "Welcome Mr. Smith" if the user's gender is male, or "Welcome Mrs. Jones" if the user's gender is female. You can utilise the existing TYPOlight/Contao insert tag {â€Ž{user::gender[}] for that purpose.
