    title: Password validation
    description: >
        This extension validates user and member passwords against your password policy. You can also force members to do a password-change.

        You can require a minimum password length, certain characters or force a password change after a fixed time frame. All configuration takes place via the config.yml, so please make sure to check the README file that you can find in the GitHub repository.
