    title: Config Form for Contao
    description: >
        Use config files instead of the form generator to define forms. This
        makes forms more easily portable.
        The forms behave the same way Form Generator forms do because they are
        rendered, validated and processed by the Contao core. This means all
        configuration options (e. g. email) and hooks are available.
